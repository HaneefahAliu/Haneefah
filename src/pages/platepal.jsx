                    <p>Meal planning and preparation can take a lot of searching through numerous websites and recipe databases, generating lists, and searching for matching recipes, which is already stressful enough. </p>
                        <p>According to WHO, 16% of the global population, or one in every six of us has a disabilty. When designing applications, people with disabilities are not fully considered in the design process but rather as an afterthought. Because of this, a lot of people with disabilities struggle when using the web.</p>
                        <p>In essence, people with disabilities are denied of the opportunity to enjoy a healthy and fulfilling cooking experience, which makes it extremely important to recognise the current issues brought about by the absence of inclusive tools for meal planning and recipe discovery and improve their experience so that they can participate fully in society without restrictions.</p>

                        <p>To ensure PlatePal caters to a diverse user base, I created four personas based on my research. These personas consider user disabilities, their challenges with existing systems, the assistive technologies they rely on, and the specific situations where they would use PlatePal. I also developed user scenarios to showcase real-world situations where users might encounter specific challenges while planning meals. These helped me understand how users would interact with PlatePal and identify potential pain points to address.</p>

                        <p>I wanted to create an interface that was both visually appealing and user-friendly. To achieve this, I aimed to strike a balance between playful elements and practicality to help users  complete their tasks efficiently. I started by sketching out various design solutions to brainstorm ideas and then selected the option that offered the best balance of these goals.</p>

                <p className='pb-5'>The sketches represent my design concepts, which are intended to fulfil the needs of all users. The user interface was designed to have a clean and structured layout, with whitespaces distinguishing between objects and displaying concise navigation between pages in the program. These paper drawings demonstrate how I applied numerous WCAG criteria to make the application inclusive and accessible to individuals with impairments. </p>

                        <p>After solidifying the general layout with paper prototypes, I moved on to creating a high-fidelity version. This allowed me to incorporate the final visual elements like colors, icons, and typography. Accessibility was a major focus.</p>

                <p>Choosing a colour palette that allows for enough contrast between the the background, typography, and content was vital. (Enhanced contrast in WCAG 1.4.6). To ensure clear visibility, a white background (#FFFFFF) with a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was combined with a shade of green (#004B23) as the primary colour and the text colour (#0A071A).I decided to use the Urbanist, a modern sans-serif typeface, throughout the entire application's design to improve text readability across platforms because it strikes a good mix between being extremely readable and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

Smartwatches provide a compact and convenient way for users to quickly access information without having to take out their smartphones. By tailoring the application to the unique characteristics of smartphones, smartwatches, and tablets, users can access, interact with, and enjoy the application regardless of their abilities or the device they use.</p>
