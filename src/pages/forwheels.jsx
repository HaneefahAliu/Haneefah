Many car owners have poor maintenance habits, many engineering students struggle to learn because they see more equations than actual cars while studying, and training technicians is expensive and hazardous, with risk of heavy artillery misuse leading to life-changing injuries and death sometimes.</p>

The goal of the research was to identify current weaknesses, new market trends, and possible competitors in order to provide guidance for creating an efficient augmented reality application.</p>

                    <p>We recruited twelve participants aged 20-45 to test our augmented reality solution. This group included a mix of vehicle owners and students with varying levels of experience using technology. To assess usability, we assigned participants specific tasks to complete while using the AR solution. We encouraged them to think aloud throughout the process, verbalizing their thoughts and thought processes.  In addition to these observations, we conducted interviews and used the System Usability Scale (SUS) to gather further data and evaluate the overall user experience.</p>

The titles seem a bit vague, and I don't immediately know what each item means.¬† Maybe some videos, images, or icons around each of the titles will let users know what the individual sections mean, and what they‚Äôre about to commit to.‚Äù"</p>

                        <p>Developing ForWheels was a collaborative and enriching experience. Working alongside a talented team of four other individuals, we tried tackled the challenge of revolutionizing automotive training and education. </p>

                            <li>We haven‚Äôt been able to integrate collaborative AR where people can work together over long distances.</li>
                            <li>The application is heavily dependent on internet connection.</li>
                            <li>Hololens2 has poor battery life.</li>
                            <li>Hololens 2 tends to overgeat with extensive usage over time.</li>
