                <h2>overview.</h2>
                <p className='pb-5'>In a rapidly evolving automotive industry, the need for innovative training and education solutions has become imperative. ForWheels is an augmented reality (AR) application designed to address this need by providing a comprehensive platform for Automotive training and education, design and engineering and car maintenance.</p>

                <div className='contentCard mb-5'>
                    <h2 className='py-3'>üéØ goal</h2>
                    <p>Revolutionise the automotive industry by implementing an augmented reality (AR) framework for comprehensive training, design, and vehicle maintenance.</p>

                <div className='contentCard'>
                    <h2 className='py-3'>üí° solution</h2>
                    <p>Forwheels is an automotive learning application that enhances the learning experience of the users by introducting new concepts in a visually engaging manner. It helps grow users confidence in the things they‚Äôre already conversant with, and improves automobile maintenance practice using augmented reality technology. The project focuses on: automotive training and education, design and engineering, parts and components and car maintenance.</p>

                <h2 className='pt-5'>how it started...</h2>
                <p className='pb-3'>Cars are a huge part of our lives, societies and civilization at large. They make life easier, they‚Äôre symbols of status, and they inspire children to dream.</p>
                <p className='pb-3'>However, there are gaps in this relationship between man and machine. Many car owners have poor maintenance habits, many engineering students struggle to learn because they see more equations than actual cars while studying, and training technicians is expensive and hazardous, with risk of heavy artillery misuse leading to life-changing injuries and death sometimes.</p>
            
                <p className='pb-4'>Prior to starting the design of forwheels, we conducted an extensive market research study to gather information about the current state of automotive education and training at the time. The goal of the research was to identify current weaknesses, new market trends, and possible competitors in order to provide guidance for creating an efficient augmented reality application.</p>

                </IKContext>
                <p className='py-3'>Once we established the needs of the business from the market research, we conducted user interviews with individuals who fit the product's purpose in order to understand their training requirements and pain points.</p>
                <p className='pb-3'>We had two objectives. The first was to gain a deeper understanding of preferred learning methods, and the second was to learn about prevalent habits pertaining to vehicle ownership and maintenance.</p>
            
                <h2 className='pt-5'>who are the users?</h2>
                <p className='pb-3'>The application targets automotive engineers, mechanic and maintenance professionals, car owners, learning specialists and engineering students looking for (complete sentence)</p>
                <p className='pb-3'>We spoke to these users and we were able to sort the information using the say-think-feel-do framework to compartmentalise the information and hone in on the emotion behind the users pain points.</p>

In addition to these observations, we conducted interviews and used the System Usability Scale (SUS) to gather further data and evaluate the overall user experience.</p>
